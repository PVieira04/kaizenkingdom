By cultivating a vibrant community of individuals who yearn to better themselves through knowledge, we establish a dynamic "kingdom" of like-minded learners.

## Mascot

Introducing a mascot to this project can serve as a powerful symbol for this educational initiative. Here is why I think having a mascot is a fantastic idea:

1. Emotional Connection: A mascot instantly connects with people on an emotional level. It's like having a friendly face that everyone can relate to and feel comfortable with.

2. Brand Identity Boost: A well-designed mascot becomes the visual representation of our project. It helps us stand out from the crowd, making us memorable and recognizable.

3. Fun and Engaging: A mascot adds a lots of fun to the learning experience! It brings an element of playfulness and excitement that keeps learners engaged and motivated.

4. Positive Learning Environment: The mascot sets a positive tone for learning. It creates a welcoming atmosphere, encourages participation, and boosts morale among learners.

5. Clear Communication: The mascot can become the project's spokesperson, delivering messages and information in a relatable and engaging way. It helps simplify complex concepts and makes learning more accessible.

Having a mascot is all about injecting personality and charm into the project. It adds that extra spark that makes learning enjoyable and memorable for everyone involved.

I have chosen the charming Kitsune as the mascot for our project. Drawing inspiration from the Japanese mythological fox renowned for its wisdom and intelligence, our mascot embodies the spirit of learning and growth. Now, let's decide on the perfect name from our two options: Kaiki and Kaiko. Here's a breakdown of each name:

Kaiki: This name creatively combines the first syllables from our project's title, capturing its uniqueness and emphasizing our commitment to continuous improvement. To symbolize the mysterious and enchanting nature of our mascot, we can associate the kanji 怪奇, meaning "mysterious" or "strange," with the name Kaiki.

Kaiko: Similarly derived, the name Kaiko incorporates the "ko" syllable from the Japanese word for "kingdom" (oukoku). It represents the grandeur and scale of our project, while maintaining a touch of Japanese influence. The kanji 開光, which signifies "opening" and "enlightenment," perfectly aligns with our mascot's transformative power and the essence of education.

To ensure our decision resonates with our target audience, we will conduct market research, gathering valuable insights and preferences. Additionally, considering the gender of our mascot, if relevant, can further enhance its appeal and connection with our learners.

By combining market feedback, personal preference, and the desired branding objectives, we can confidently select the name that best captures the essence of our educational journey and creates a lasting impression.

Decision: to be determined.
