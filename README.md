# Kaizen Kingdom

Welcome to Kaizen Kingdom. This is a project dedicated to creating a fully functional Llearning Management System so that learners can learn whatever they wish!

Kaizen is a japanese word which can be literally translated as "improvement". This fits as the theme of the project becasue one can continually improve themselves through learning. The idea is to establish a "kingdom" full of people that wish to improve themselves through learning.

For branding purposes, I want to have some kind of mascot which fits the theme of education, and perhaps with a Japanese twist. The kitsune is a Japanese mythological fox often associated with wisdom and intelligence - a perfect fit. It would be appropriate to give the mascot a name. I am considering two names - Kaiki and Kaiko. Kaiki is created using the first syllables of each word of this project. Kaiko is done in a similar way but the 'ko' comes from the Japanese of the word 'kingdom' - 'oukoku'. Things which could sway my decision would be the macot's gender(if defined at all), an appropriate kanji for the name and market research.
