# Kaizen Kingdom

Welcome to Kaizen Kingdom. This is a project dedicated to creating a fully functional Llearning Management System so that learners can learn whatever they wish!

Kaizen is a japanese word which can be literally translated as "improvement". This fits as the theme of the project becasue one can continually improve themselves through learning. The idea is to establish a "kingdom" full of people that wish to improve themselves through learning.
